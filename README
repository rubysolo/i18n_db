= i18n_db: database-powered namespaced translations for Rails

This is an unfinished Rails-2.2 internationalization plugin with a specific set of features in mind:

* Only strings (with macro substitutions) are translated. Something that one would write directly in the view templates for a monolingual site, plus error messages.
* No support for model translations at this stage.
* No support for pluralization initially.

Each translated string can be seen as an ActiveRecord model, enabling easier construction of a web interface for translators. Deeply nested namespaces are supported and encouraged, so that this collection of strings does not turn into mess too quickly.

After loading, the translated strings are cached by standard Rails mechanisms and the default Simple internationalization backend takes over and displays them.

Based on the code of http://github.com/yannlugrin/globalize/ (for Rails 2.0) and http://github.com/iain/i18n_yaml
